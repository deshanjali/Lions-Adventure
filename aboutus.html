			<h3 id="LA">Meemure Lions Adventure in Sri Lanka</h3>

			Meemure is a small village in the center of Sri Lanka. A rain forestry area, which gets two monsoons each year, and is one of the wettest places in Sri Lanka. Nevertheless, it comes alive in the first three months of the year,
			especially in February, the driest month. The Academy Award-winning movie <b>Sooriya Arana</b> was filmed on the Heen Ganga river near Meemure, although Meemure displays historical view of great ancient kingdoms.<br><br>
			 Large numbers of people make the excursion from all over the country at weekends to enjoy the beautiful scenery, play in the river, Jungle Walks, Adventurous water fall jumps/ slides, White Water Rafting and have an 
			 excellent rice and curry lunch at the local restaurants. The Heen Ganga river is wide at meemure, but it is shallow apart from a deep channel near the opposite bank, so in the drier months it provides a safe and attractive 
			 place to swim, wash and play. Many birders stay at Meemure. This area has most of the rainforest animal species that are found at the forest monaragala, although in lower numbers. However, the secondary forest and cultivation 
			 at meemure is more open than the pristine woodlands of Monaragala, and elusive endemic species like Sri Lanka Spurfowl, Green-billed Coucal and Spot-winged Thrush may be easier to see. So Meemure is a primary spot for adventure hunters.<br><br> 
			 Inside the jungles of Meemure there are plenty of camping opportunities which can be coupled with White Water Rafting, Jungle Walks, River bathing and many adventure activities. If you are looking at a adventure and 
			 leisure base, Meemure is THE PLACE. If you stay for one night you would be able to do many adventure and leisure activities such as White Water Rafting, Bird Watching Walking in the Jungle, Visiting pre historic caves, 
			 Bathing in the river, Visiting waterfalls, Swimming in natural ponds, Mountain biking etc. So, try Meemure camping on a weekend, it's highly recommended.
