			<h3 style="text-align:center">Cycling</h3>
			<p class="description">
			Travelling and the bicycle have been in a serious committed relationship for centuries, and it’s not hard to understand why. Just about every environment, 
			from desert to mountain to rolling prairie, is accessible with a trusty bike, and the world is always eager to offer options aplenty for leisurely pedallers and 
			hardcore asphalt-eaters alike. Cycling through your destination brings you closer to the land and its people than just about any other style of travel. The mobility of a 
			bike gives you the chance to see well-known locales from a new perspective and opens up their more remote corners to deeper exploration. And since you control the pace, you’re 
			free to stop at a friendly café or roadside market whenever you like, or turn that rolling field you just passed into an impromptu picnic spot.<br><br>
			Come see and explore the beauty of Meemure village with your riding skills...
